# State Management Bug Report

## Files Analyzed

- `electron/main/services/StateManager.ts`
- `electron/main/bridge/StateBridge.ts`
- `src/store/appStore.ts`

## Potential Bugs Found

### 5. Async Operation Without Error Boundaries

**Location**: appStore.ts:515-521
**Issue**: The initial state fetch happens outside any error boundary and only logs errors. If this fails, the app starts with no state and no user feedback.
**Fix**: Implement a proper error state or retry mechanism for initial state loading.

### 8. Missing Validation in Page Updates

**Location**: StateManager.ts:178-186
**Issue**: The `updatePage` method applies partial updates without validating the updates. Malformed data could corrupt the page state.
**Fix**: Add validation for the update fields before applying them.

### 9. Potential Null Reference in Container Bounds

**Location**: appStore.ts:259-274
**Issue**: The `updateContainerBounds` method sets bounds to null if no container exists, but other parts of the code don't always check for null before using these bounds.
**Fix**: Add null checks wherever containerBounds is accessed, or provide default bounds.

### 10. State Sync Race Condition

**Location**: appStore.ts:506-512
**Issue**: The IPC listeners for state sync are set up after the store is created. If state changes arrive before listeners are attached, they'll be missed.
**Fix**: Set up listeners before creating the store or queue early messages.

## Summary

These bugs range from minor issues to potentially significant problems that could affect application stability and user experience. Priority should be given to:

1. Memory leak in StateBridge (Bug #3)
2. State sync race condition (Bug #10)
3. Initial state loading error handling (Bug #5)
