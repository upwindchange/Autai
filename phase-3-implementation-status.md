# Phase 3 Implementation Status

## Completed Implementation Details

### 1. Type Definitions and Interfaces

#### Created Files:
- `electron/shared/types/auiThread.ts` - Core type definitions
- `electron/shared/types/services/auiThread.ts` - Service interfaces

#### Key Types:
- **AuiView**: Represents a browser view with `id`, `threadId`, `url`, `title`, `favicon`
- **AuiViewMetadata**: Tracks view display state with `bounds` and `isVisible`
- **AuiThreadViewState**: Maps threads to their views and active view
- **Command Types**: `CreateAuiViewCommand`, `NavigateAuiViewCommand`, etc.
- **Event Types**: `AuiThreadEvent`, `AuiViewEvent` for lifecycle management
- **BrowserAction**: Unified interface for browser automation (navigate, click, type, etc.)

### 2. Backend Services Implementation

#### AuiThreadViewManager (`electron/main/services/AuiThreadViewManager.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages thread-view relationships
- **Key Features**:
  - Tracks which views belong to which threads
  - Handles thread lifecycle (created, deleted, switched)
  - Maintains active thread state
  - Event emission for thread/view changes
  - Clean bidirectional mappings (thread→views, view→thread)

#### BrowserViewManager (`electron/main/services/BrowserViewManager.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Manages WebContentsView lifecycle
- **Key Features**:
  - Creates/destroys WebContentsView instances
  - Handles navigation, script execution, screenshots
  - Implements all BrowserAction types
  - Auto-injects helper scripts (hintDetector, buildDomTree)
  - Comprehensive event handling (navigation, crashes, console)
  - Clean resource cleanup on destroy

#### ViewOrchestrator (`electron/main/services/ViewOrchestrator.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Coordinates between managers and provides unified API
- **Key Features**:
  - Creates views for threads with proper registration
  - Manages view activation and visibility
  - Handles bounds updates and metadata tracking
  - Thread switching logic (shows/hides appropriate views)
  - Single active view enforcement

### 3. IPC Bridge Implementation

#### AuiThreadBridge (`electron/main/bridge/AuiThreadBridge.ts`)
- **IPC Channels Implemented**:
  - Thread lifecycle: `auiThread:created`, `auiThread:switched`, `auiThread:deleted`
  - View operations: `auiView:create`, `auiView:navigate`, `auiView:execute`, `auiView:close`
  - View state: `auiView:setBounds`, `auiView:setVisibility`, `auiView:setActive`
  - Query operations: `auiThread:getViews`, `auiThread:getActiveView`, `auiThread:getState`
- **Event Forwarding**: Automatically forwards thread/view events to renderer

### 4. Frontend Type Updates

#### Updated `src/vite-env.d.ts`
- Added all new AuiThread types to imports
- Defined IPC channel types for:
  - All thread operations
  - All view operations
  - Event listeners for `auiThread:event` and `auiView:event`
  - Proper TypeScript typing for all channels

## Architecture Decisions

1. **No Pages/Tabs Concept**: Views are just browser instances associated with threads
2. **Thread-First Design**: All operations start from thread context
3. **Interface-Driven**: All services implement interfaces for testability
4. **Event-Driven**: Thread lifecycle drives view lifecycle automatically
5. **Clean Separation**: Each service has single responsibility
6. **No Timestamps**: Removed `createdAt` as requested
7. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive Zod schemas for validation

## Remaining Steps (Brief)

### 7. Create Frontend Browser Store and Components
- Create `src/stores/browserStore.ts` using Zustand
- Track active thread's views and browser state
- Components needed:
  - `BrowserContainer` - Main container
  - `BrowserTabBar` - Tab UI
  - `BrowserView` - WebContentsView wrapper
  - `BrowserControls` - Navigation buttons

### 8. Integrate with Assistant-UI Runtime
- Hook into thread lifecycle events from assistant-ui
- Auto-create view when thread created
- Clean up views when thread deleted
- Update main process initialization

### 9. Test New Architecture
- Test thread lifecycle
- Test view creation/destruction
- Test navigation and browser actions
- Test bounds and visibility
- Verify old code can be safely removed

## Migration Strategy Notes

- New services run parallel to old ones initially
- No breaking changes until fully tested
- Gradual cutover approach
- Keep old code in `_legacy` folder for reference

## Next Session Starting Points

1. Start with browserStore.ts implementation
2. Create React components for browser UI
3. Wire up assistant-ui runtime hooks
4. Begin testing with simple scenarios
